# AInimal Detector

## Overview

AInimal Detector is an innovative project that employs deep learning with YOLO (You Only Look Once) to effectively detect animals in images and videos. Specifically designed to support researchers in fields requiring animal detection, such as camera traps, this project is actively contributing to a Master's project at UFJF (Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora).

## Features

- **Animal Detection:** Utilizes YOLO to accurately identify and locate animals in images and videos.
- **User Interface:** Built with PyQt, providing an intuitive and interactive experience for users.
- **Multi-platform Support:** Compatible with various platforms, ensuring accessibility for a broad audience.
- **Easy Integration:** Simple and straightforward integration with your existing workflow.
